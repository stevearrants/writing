Content for SJS end users
=========================

This is a general guide for Technology staff to use when creating documents for
internal or external audiences. You'll find general guidelines for talking to
the user, how to write, and other subjects. Please read before you start
writing.

Questions, comments
-------------------

I welcome your questions, your comments, your suggestions and corrections. Do
you need to know how to create a training video? I can show you. Want to know
how to break that 25-step procedure in to smaller chunks? [Ask me!

How to use this guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

This guide helps technology writers create content that is both easy to
understand and meets people where they are. Documentation often just talks *at*
readers and end-users rather than *to* or *with* them. Most writing leaves this
audience frustrated by information that is neither actionable nor
understandable.

This guide hopes to address this and offers several common-sense guidelines
about writing for a diverse audience. Using this guide is the first step in
collaborating with the audience, incorporating their experience and feedback
into the process, by communicating in a consistent manner.

What does Steve do here?

Here's a short video.

Some quick tips on writing for the end user.

If you work in Technology
-------------------------

Use this guide as a reference as-needed. Use it when you’re wondering whether to
capitalize the word *submit*, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to
create a friendly, informational document.

I structured this guide into descriptively named sections. Find the topic you’re
looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword. Use it the way that
makes sense to you.

If you have any suggestions or want to get involved, please click the link at
the bottom of each page to send an email.

If you work outside Technology
------------------------------

Use this guide and adapt it to your group's needs. This is just a guide. If a
section isn’t relevant to you and your team, ignore it. If there is something
missing, let me know and I'll add it. This guide is a Sheridan Resource. It is
intended to serve our business needs. As they change, so will this guide. Update
it in the ways that best suit you.

Resources
=========

My background is in user assistance and documentation that uses plain language
and accessibility. Here are some guides I use when I have a question.

Style guides
------------

I generally follow [Microsoft Writing Style
Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). I use this for
computer, interface, and software terms, unless otherwise noted. The other
important resource I use are:

-   [The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th
    ed.](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)

-   [Plain Language Action and Information Network
    ](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/)

-   [Diversity Style Guide ](http://www.diversitystyleguide.com/)

I just found this site, [The Punctuation
Guide](http://www.thepunctuationguide.com/index.html) , for all things
punctuation.

Sheridan Terms
--------------

The Production group has a nicely comprehensive list of terms specific to SJS,
[glossaries.xlsx](file:///J:/Production%20Information/Training/Orientation_Training%20docs/12%20overview%20of%20production%20fundamentals/glossaries.xlsx)

For questions about the Sheridan corporate logo and branding information, I go
to [Sheridan Logos and Branding](file:///J:/Sheridan%20Logos%20and%20Branding)
on the shared server.

Approach
========

In this section we present some tips and standards for developing user-centered
content.

Principles for user content
===========================

Start with user needs
---------------------

Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: *Who am I writing for?
What do they need to know? What is their situation, constraints, and
environment?*

Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them
through the journey.

Do the hard work to make it simple
----------------------------------

Use plain language and simple sentences.

Be clear, not clever.

Write as if you're speaking to your mom or dad.

Write for the audience, not yourself
------------------------------------

Our end-users, customers, and all readers have complex experiences and
backgrounds. Respect that.

Know the audience. I can't stress this enough! Talk to them. Don't ask what they
*want*. Observe and give them what they *need*.

Build trust with the reader
---------------------------

Talk like a person, not Siri or Amazon Echo.

Don't sugar coat a problem. Tell the truth.

Use positive language and concrete, real world examples.

Start small and build big
-------------------------

Does your content works for users? Don’t be afraid to rethink and rewrite.

Write a draft. Test on your users and readers. Examine their feedback. Refine.
Make it better, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.

Address your user
=================

Content from Technology often asks the reader to do something or take some action
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the second person singular whenever you can.

You can get training to use the Element Editor.

Find out how your JIRA Service Desk account works.

If you create content for multiple users, say a group leader and their group,
address the primary user as *you* and refer to the other users by their role or
titles.

You can adjust the settings for Production Specialists in the Admin panel.

Avoid duplication
=================

If something is written once and you can easily link to it, do so. Duplicate
content produces poor search results, confuses the user, and you can't be sure
it is current.

If users can find two similar yet slightly different pieces of content, they
will stop what they are doing and ask for guidance. Worse, some just decide the
first one they found is correct, or the one with the latest date, or the file
found in a specific folder.

At SJS we have hundreds of file folders on many, many servers. That's a lot of
content that's been needlessly duplicated. Consolidate. Direct the reader to the
right location — ask someone if you aren't sure.

Before you start writing, check to see it hasn't already been written. Ask
someone.

Be concise
==========

Good content should be:

-   Specific.

-   Informative.

-   Clear and concise.

-   Brisk but not terse.

-   Incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary
    words) but human (not something generated by Siri).

-   Serious but not pompous or emotionless—be sparing with adjectives. They're
    subjective and make the text sound emotive and inauthentic.

You should:

-   Use contractions.

-   Don't use unwieldy grammar (for example, say *You can* rather than *You may
    be able to*).

-   Use short sentences.

-   Use the language and terms your readers use.

-   Don't turn verbs into nouns! They put the reader to sleep.

Keep sentences and paragraphs short 
------------------------------------

If a sentence has more than 25 words, try to split it to make the points
clearer. If a sentence has under 14-20 words, readers understand 90 percent of
content. At 25 words, sentences are more difficult to comprehend.

Vary sentence length. This helps keep readers interested and varies your tone.
Too many short sentences sound terse and like you're giving orders. Longer
sentences help the flow as well.

Do the same for paragraphs. If it looks long, try to break it up. Let's look at
some examples. Instead of:

*The Terminator is used in conjunction with a large number of other publishers.
Generally, we update the program on a quarterly basis whenever changes are
implemented. When an update is scheduled for release, we will alert you that
there is an update available. It is your responsibility to download and install
the newest release and then to ensure you are working with the latest version.*

Use:

*We use the Terminator with many customers. We update it quarterly and we'll
share updates when released. Remember that you are responsible to ensure you
have the latest version.*

Use plain language
==================

Our content should be as straightforward as possible
----------------------------------------------------

Clear and usable content uses plain language. Plain language makes our content
more findable, more accessible, and easier to understand.

Jargon, formal language, and long phrases separate us from the reader and erode
trust. They also lead to misinterpretation and confusion.

Figurative language doesn’t say what you actually mean and makes content harder
to understand. Here are some examples:

-   **drive** (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)

-   **drive out** (unless it’s cattle)

-   **going forward** (unless you’re giving directions)

To avoid this, describe what you're actually doing. Be specific. Be open.

Don't say *Input your change. Say Type your change.*

Think of your writing as a conversation, not a lecture.

Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short words say the same thing. Use
*help* instead of *assist*, *about* instead of *approximately*.

Plain language is more than just a proscriptive list though, it’s a way of
writing.

What about legal terms?
-----------------------

**Never** rewrite legal information, such as a copyright, terms of use
statements, privacy statement, or other document that could open SJS to
litigation. These documents are express or implied contracts. Ask our legal
department for assistance.

Structure the content
=====================

Most of our documentation is read online. Here are some tips for presenting it.

Important information first
---------------------------

Readers tend to scan text until they find the information they need. No matter
how carefully you lay out and write the content, most people only read 25
percent of it. This shows the importance of getting content right.

Put the most important information in the first two paragraphs. That’s the
section users are most likely to read. In journalism, this technique is called
the “inverted pyramid.”

Break up text
-------------

A wall of text overwhelms readers. Use subheads and bullet points as they
provide clear narrative structure for readers in a hurry. Put information-rich
words at the beginning of the phrase, and use the active voice.

Instead of:

*How to use the Schematron to validate your document and find errors*

Use:

*Validating using the Schematron*

Tables are a good way to visualize a lot of data. Long paragraphs with a lot of
names, dates, and other information are much more difficult to scan than,

| Dates covered         | Report Due |
|-----------------------|------------|
| January 1–March 31    | April 15   |
| April 1–June 30       | July 15    |
| July 1–September 30   | October 15 |
| October 1–December 31 | January 31 |

What about FAQs?
----------------

FAQs are easy to write and structure—too easy. They:

-   Can be hard to read and search for

-   May duplicate other content on your site

-   Mean that content is not where people expect to find it.

If you’re thinking about posting FAQs, review the content and look for ways to
improve it. Unless there's a compelling reason, avoid FAQs.

Style
=====

This section contains information on grammar, spelling, and mechanics.

Active voice
============

Our writing should be concise and direct. The active voice supports brevity and
makes written content more engaging, too. The active voice helps the reader
identify the subject of the sentence. In the following example, the person who
submits the form is essential information. Omitting that leads to a confusing
and impersonal sentence.

Passive: *The Tobacco Waiver form must be submitted to the appropriate
representative.*

Active: *Submit the Tobacco Waiver form to Human Resources.*

The passive de-emphasizes who should take an action and anything written in the
passive voice is usually longer. Wordy instructions are harder to follow.

Passive: *The JIRA notice should be saved in your email, as it will be required
for future inquiries.*

Active: *Save the JIRA notice in your email for later use.*

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.

How to recognize the passive voice
----------------------------------

Use of the passive voice is common enough that many people don’t notice when
they use it. Here’s a simple way to recognize it. If you insert *by zombies*
after the verb and the sentence still makes sense, you’re using the passive
voice.

*The form was submitted by zombies.*

*Ted's oatmeal cookies were consumed by zombies.*

When to use the passive voice
-----------------------------

There are always exceptions. Never use the passive voice in a way that makes
actions seem like they happen without anyone doing them. In our documentation,
we should always make it clear who (or what) is doing something.

You may need to use the passive voice to soften an error message or make
something easier to understand.

Rewording either of these sentences to use the active voice would complicate the
sentence or pull focus away from its main point:

*Responses sent from JIRA include Waiting for Support and Closed.*

*Support is required to respond to requests within 4 working hours.*

Present tense
=============

In technical writing, present tense is easier to read and understand than past
or future tense. Simple verbs are easier to understand than complex verbs, such
as those in the progressive or perfect tense. And most users are reading while
in the middle of a procedure, trying to troubleshoot or solve a problem.

Especially for procedures, think of the user as they follow the steps — they're
"in the now."

*Although ArticleExpress is reliable, save your work often.*

*Click Open. ARTEMIS displays the file contents.*

*As you work, ArticleExpress warns you of potential errors.*

instead of

*Click the Bold icon. ArticleExpress will format the selection.*

*While working, ARTEMIS will stop if you have made an error.*

*When you click Submit, ArticleExpress will have formatted the document and you
should have had time to complete other tasks.*

Capitalization
==============

Follow a consistent capitalization scheme
-----------------------------------------

Inconsistent spellings and capitalization undermine your narrative authority.
Follow these capitalization guidelines:

-   Capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and
    companies.

-   Don’t capitalize *agile* or *open source*, unless either opens a sentence.

-   Don’t capitalize *submit* as an action, but do capitalize it if it is the
    name of an interface item or the first word of a sentence.

When you’re deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in
English, title case is often a marker of formality. It can help clarify that
you’re speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or
person). But overuse can cause confusion.

Headings
--------

Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow sentence
case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

-   *Using the Insert Citation command on your proof*

-   *ARTEMIS roles and responsibilities*

Punctuation
===========

Bulleted lists
--------------

Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Don’t use semicolons after points in
a bulleted list. Include a period at the end of the bullet only if that point is
a complete sentence. And if one bullet point requires a period, all should have
a period. For example:

*When you go to the store, please buy:*

-   *Milk*

-   *Apples*

-   *Cod cakes*

*When you leave the house:*

-   *Please buy apples, bananas, and cod cakes.*

-   *Fill the car with gas.*

*I need these things done:*

-   *Shopping.*

-   *Weeding.*

-   *Make sure the plants are watered.*

Colons
------

Capitalize the first word after a colon if a colon introduces a direct quotation
or the first word after a colon is a proper noun. For example:

*The dolphins left a note that said: "So long and thanks for all the fish!"*

*There were two types of steaks: Porterhouse and Sirloin.*

Semicolons
----------

Use semicolons sparingly. They are difficult to see on some hand-held devices.
Semicolons can sometimes confuse non-native English speakers. For example, in
Greek you end a question with a semicolon. In Arabic a semicolon denotes a
direct causal relationship between different phrases.

Try rewriting the sentence or paragraph to make it more readable.

Commas
------

Use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or
more, include a comma before the conjunction. For example: *Please buy milk,
apples, and cod cakes.*

Dashes
------

When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the longer em dash (—) with
a space on either side of the dash. For example:

*We emphasize specific, customer-centered workflows, and — whenever possible —
we preserve your current workflow.*

Although we advocate using words rather than symbols, in some contexts you may
use an “en dash” to convey a range of numbers. For example, both *10–20
footnotes* and *10 to 20 footnotes* are acceptable options.

*We assign 2–5 people to each development team.*

Quotes
------

These quotations are correctly punctuated:

*“Would you like a milk shake?” he asked.*

*“I don't like milk shakes,” she said. “You know I detest milk shakes.”*

*He paused before saying, “Well, how about a Pepsi?”*

Spaces
------

Sentences should always be separated by a single space. Never two spaces.

Ampersands or plus signs
------------------------

Use *and* instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they’re part of an
official title or company name. For example, *Hoefler & Co.*

Slashes
-------

Avoid using the slash */* symbol. Replace it with words or commas as
appropriate.

Images
======

Graphics and other visual elements clarify. Screen shots are easy to produce and
format using SnagIt and other tools.

-   **Address the user** Focus on illustrating or drawing attention to specific
    points you want them to understand.

-   **Be concise** Don’t go crazy. Use the images to enhance, not overwhelm the
    document.

-   **Be conscious** Use real examples with the most current software.

Common uses of imagery 
-----------------------

Screenshots can go a long way in explaining design and user-experience
techniques in how-to pieces. Use them to illustrate functionality, show users a
series of steps, or give examples.

An image that spans the full width of a web page should be no more than 800
pixels wide. If possible, use vector images in the SVG format as they scale
well. Use PNG if you can't use SVG. Captions aren't necessary in procedures

If your content will be viewed on hand-held devices, make them responsive. That
is, provide different image sizes depending on the device.

For documents created with Flare or other online tools, take the screen shot and
reduce to 72-75% in SnagIt. Then use the Sharpen filter set at between 72-75%.
Place in Flare and set to display the thumbnail as a pop-up image. Please
contact Steve Arrants for assistance.

Copyrighted images
------------------

Don't use them, even if the document is internal to Sheridan. Don't alter a
copyrighted image and use it. Instead, search for and use public domain [CC0
Images](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

Accessibility
-------------

While we aren't required to follow [Section
508](http://www.508checker.com/what-is-508-compliance) guidelines, some of our
customers are required to comply with Section 508. They may expect or require
vendors (such as SJS) to comply as well. The broad requirement is that any
information presented in an image must also be presented in an alternative
format (for people who cannot view images).

The [W3C Web Accessibility initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) is a good
resource for all web accessibility issues.

Every image presented online must have alt text describing the image.
Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the alt
text. Most screen readers already add *Image of* when reading out an image, so
alt text like *Image of Edit Citation dialog box* is redundant because screen
readers will read it *Image of image of edit citation dialog box*. Try to limit
alt text to 15 to 25words. if you need to have a longer explanation, add it to
the page as a description for the action involved.

When captioning an image, don't add additional context or information. Don’t
merely repeat what the user sees by looking at the image. Captions should
increase depth and understanding.

Abbreviations and acronyms
==========================

Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. For example,
writing *HWP* instead of *High Wire Press*, or *PAP* for *Publish Ahead of
Print*.

In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms
(abbreviations pronounced as words, like ARTEMIS) and initialisms (abbreviations
pronounced as letters, like HWP). This guide refers to both as acronyms. The
readability issues that acronyms and initialisms create tend to be similar.

Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible, unless you're
writing for an internal, Sheridan audience.

If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell the full word and follow
with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For example,
*ARTEMIS closes the task after PAP (Publish Ahead of Print)*. For online
HTML-formatted documents, we can sometimes have a pop-up[^1] with the full
acronym or abbreviation appear.

[^1]: Here's a pop-up example (or rather, a pop-under).

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example,
*SJS*. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s
discretion.

Numbers and percentages
=======================

Numbers
-------

Generally speaking, we follow the guidelines outlined in the Microsoft Manual of
Style, Fourth Edition However, if the document is for a more general audience
and isn't primarily instruction, follow T[he Chicago Manual of Style, 16th
edition](http://login.chicagomanualofstyle.org/action/login)

In body copy, spell out numbers zero through nine, and use numerals for numbers
10 and greater. This is true of ordinal numbers, as well. Spell out first to
ninth, and then use 10th or greater.

In titles, subheadings, and interface labels, we use numerals instead of
spelling out numbers. For example, *10 tips for using FreeStyle* or *6 steps to
better footnotes*. This promotes ease of reading and scannability. In titles and
headings, it’s easier for readers to scan numerals than it is for them to scan
written-out numbers.

Dates
-----

Use the full, four-digit year. For informal writing, it’s okay to use an
abbreviated form. For example*, We’re thankful printing technology isn’t stuck
in the ’90s!*

Do not use dates only such as *10/2/18*. In the US we read that as October 2,
2018. In other parts of the world, it is 10 February 2018.

Percentages
-----------

Spell out *percent* in most cases. However, use the percent sign (%) in these
cases to improve content scannability and allow readers to digest the content
more quickly:

-   Tables and in technical or scientific writing. For example: *If the progress
    meter sits at 60% or lower for more than 20 minutes, close the program and
    start again.*

-   Headings and subheadings. For example: *Clearing 100% of all errors.*

-   Interface labels.

-   Captions .

Word list
=========

Here are some rules using common words and phrases. The bold term shows the
accepted form (capitalization, hyphenation, punctuation), with accompanying text
explaining usage.

-   **a.m.**

-   **dialog** when used for interface items. It is a *dialog* box, not a
    *dialogue* box.

-   **drop-down** when used as an adjective. For example, *drop-down menu*.
    **drop down** when used as a noun. For example, a*n option from the drop
    down*. Never *dropdown*.

-   **email**, not *e-mail*

-   **internet**

-   **login** when used as noun, for example, *I forgot my login name and
    password*, or when used as an adjective, for example *Make sure the login
    page is available.* **Log in** when used as a verb, for example, *Log in to
    edit the proof.*

-   **p.m.**

-   **URLs** should be lowercase, even when they appear at the start of a
    sentence. For example, *sheridan.com is our new web address.* If a URL ends
    a sentence, do not include terminal punctuation. For example, *This URL goes
    to www.sheridan.com*

-   **Wi-Fi**

Writing specific content
========================

This section offers some guidance on parts of a document and how to make them
more usable.

Headings and titles
===================

Most people scan the page and make decisions based on headings. Make them active
and descriptive.

Find the right keywords
-----------------------

Ask co-workers what keywords they would expect to use. Ask end users. What
you’re calling the subject of your page might not be what your users are calling
it. While our Help files use a full-text search, Windows Server and Confluence
rely more on exact matches. Pay special attention to keywords and search terms
for you headings.

Optimize the content
--------------------

Once you know the most popular keywords, incorporate them in:

-   Titles

-   Headings

-   Introductions and summaries

-   Chapter and section titles

-   Metadata descriptions

Procedures
==========

Here are some rules of thumb for writing effective procedures.

-   Each action is a numbered step. Results do not take a number as they are not
    a step.

-   If there is only one step, use a bullet, and not the number 1.

-   Use active voice. It is easier to understand.

-   Use second person. You're talking to the user, so second person is best. You
    can even use the word "You" in your instructions (like I just did).

-   Present tense, please. Most of the time (all of the time?) users read the
    instructions when they're in the middle of trying to do something or solve a
    problem.

-   No more than 8 steps. If you require more, break the procedure up into a
    grouped set of procedures.

-   Include images and videos if they help the user.

-   Use sub-steps sparingly, and use bullets, not a, b, c, etc.

Also, don't use *Input* to show typing, or another way of entering information.
Use *Type* instead.

Here is a procedure from the ArticleExpress Help
------------------------------------------------

#### To invite a collaborator:

1.  Click the **Collaboration** tab. ArticleExpress displays the
    **Collaborators** form.

2.  Fill out the **Add/Edit Collaborator** section. ArticleExpress requires the
    name, initials, and email address.

3.  Change the **Access Level** and **Duration**, if desired.

4.  Add any message or special instructions to include in the email.

5.  Click **Send Invitation**. ArticleExpress sends the invitation to the
    designated collaborator.

Interface writing
=================

We often write technical documentation, guides, forms, and interface messages.
In most of these cases, it’s safe to say the reader is learning something new or
troubleshooting. Write clear, concise instructions that give your reader with
the best possible experience.

Basics
------

### Do the hard work to make it simple

Help the reader follow along. Break instructions or processes down into
individual steps. Use short, simple sentences with words people use in everyday
conversation.

Refer to navigation labels, buttons, and menus as they appear in the app or
website. Verify the spelling and capitalization as you write. Your reader looks
for the same name as in the instruction. Always boldface interface items and
omit any terminal punctuation.

Sometimes you'll see something like a command called Insert Caption. When the
user clicks, it displays the Edit Caption dialog box. Use the correct names. So,
you would say *Click Insert Caption. ArticleExpress displays the Edit Caption
dialog box.*

Be specific and give the reader as much help as you can.

Instead of:

*Open a new support ticket.*

Use:

*Click Help \> Contact Technical Support.*

### Direct the reader

Use active verbs or clear objectives.

Instead of:

*We can help you if you create a JIRA Service Desk request.*

Use:

*Click JIRA Service Desk to create a help request. Include details about your
problem.*

Or:

*To get started, click the JIRA Service Desk link to create a new ticket.
Remember to include the details of your problem*.

Focus on what the reader can *do* rather than what they *can’t* using positive
language.

Instead of:

*You cannot submit without answering all queries.*

Use:

*Answer any open queries and then submit the proof.*

Guidelines
----------

### Titles and headings

Use consistent naming by sticking to the same naming convention. This makes it
easier for the reader to scan and find what she's looking for. For examples:

-   **Nouns** *Proofs*, *Users*, *Task*

-   **Verbs** *Create an account*, *Print a report*, *Submit a proof*

Use sentence case for headings.

### Introduction

Include a short two- or three-sentence summary about the document to help the
reader confirm whether they’re in the right place, and also to improve
searchability.

### Interface elements

Use clear verbs to tell readers how to interact with interface elements:

*Choose* from drop-down menus.

*Select* or *clear* checkboxes and radio buttons.

*Click* or *tap* buttons.

*Follow* or *open* links.

Bold interface names and choices:

1.  Click **File \> Open**. Word opens the **File** dialog box.

2.  Select the file.

3.  Click **OK**.

Always use the spelling, grammar, and exact name seen in the interface element.

### User input

Use italic to distinguish user input from plain text. For example,

Type the exact name of the dialog box, such as *Exit_dialog*.

### Command line items 

Command line items should be in monospace, such as Courier, Consolas, or
similar. Do not use italic for this form of user input.

At the C: prompt, type the following: chkdsk /v /f and press **Enter**.
